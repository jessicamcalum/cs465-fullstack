CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN

## - Architecture
This project first began using Express to directly serve HTML files and web pages needed to fully reload to display updated content. Handlebars were then implemented to generate dynamic HTML pages. We then developed  a single-page-application (SPA) using Angular, where all interactions were handled dynamically without needing to reload the web page. The backend used a NoSQL MongoDB database because it provided a backend that’s flexible, scalable, and works well with Javascript to enhance the performance of our application. 

## - Functionality
JavaScript(JavaScript Object Notation) is a format used to store and transfer data, whereas JavaScript in a programming language. JSON helps to send data between the frontend and the server for the backend of the website. One instance where I refactored code to improve functionality by improving the error handling logic by implementing messages that would inform the user of the error, which is helpful information for identifying where the error is occurring. Reusable UI components help to make the code more maintainable and efficient.

## - Testing
In a full stack application, methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE are used for different types of actions you want to perform through API endpoints. We used Postman to help simulate API requests and responses for testing. We also used JWT where secure tokens were made after a user would login, then that token would be required to access secured endpoints. This helped to ensure that only authorized users could perform certain operations. 

## - Reflection
This class was my first introduction to full stack development, and gave me valuable knowledge that I can use in my future career.  I’ve learned so many useful skills that come with developing a working web application.
